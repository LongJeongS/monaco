## Employee Directory ##

### Sample Application built with Monaco and Twitter Bootstrap ###

"Monaco Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built with [Monaco](https://github.com/marcos-abreu/monaco) and [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

Refer to [this blog post]() for more information about the application.


The application runs out-of-the-box with the local cache feature available in Monaco, but you can also run the application using other layers available in the original application.

You can also run the application with an in-memory data provider built by the original creator of this app - [Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org/blog/bio/). Or the other persistent layers also developed by him:

- [directory-rest-nodejs](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-nodejs) (Node.js/MongoDB implementation)
- [directory-rest-php](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-php) (PHP implementation)
